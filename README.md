# ![Born, growing up. A GitHub profile by William J. Ghelfi](header.jpeg)

👋🏻 Hey, please call me Will.

🐣 Born in 1977 in Italy, I never stopped growing since.

☎️ I started programming in 1986.  
💻 Professionally in 2000.  
💅🏻 As a frontend developer in 2004.  
⛑ I'm also interested in [DevX](https://devxconf.org/).

🔮 I see myself coding till I die, all the while sharing my knowledge, helping newcomers grow, leading technical advancements and transformations, contributing to Open Source.

👨🏻‍💻 My dream job is at a product company, where I can express my love and attention for my users, fully remote or remote first, within a smallish, supportive team, working with a fairly modern tech stack, where I can keep on learning and honing my skills.

🍊 I am a [Gitpod](https://github.com/gitpod-io) Community Hero 🦸🏻.  
🐬 I am a [Nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx) Champion ⚔️.

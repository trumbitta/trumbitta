# ![Born, growing up. A GitHub profile by William J. Ghelfi](header.jpeg)

👋🏻 Hey, please call me Will.

🐣 Born in 1977 in Italy, I never stopped growing since.  

🔮 I see myself coding till I die, all the while sharing my knowledge, helping newcomers grow, leading technical advancements and transformations, contributing to Open Source.

👨🏻‍💻 My dream job is at a product company, fully remote or remote first, within a smallish, supportive team, working with a fairly modern tech stack, where I can keep on learning and honing my skills.
